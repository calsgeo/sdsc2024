        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div><p>Data and data science play key role in informed decision-making for various businesses. 3D location data and 3D data analysis add more advantages for identification of problems, patterns and trends by location and time to make smarter decisions for our cities. Smart cities get benefits from data, data science, location data and analytics to provide accurate information for better decision making at local and regional scale. Sensing technologies and real time data collectors are also great tools for collecting different dimensions of data. In a smart cities era, all these data and information require appropriate collaborative and communication technologies for better management and sharing of data and information.</p>
        <p>The Smart Data and Smart Cities (SDSC) Conference is an annual international conference that brings together international experts in city analytics, GIS, digital twins, smart cities and data science from leading research institutes to discuss advances in methods and applications. It provides a forum to discuss the use data and technology to plan and shape our future cities. SDSC is the annual conference of the Urban Data Management Society, a society over 40 years old.</p>
        <p> <b>This year the 8th annual SDSC conference will be held in Athens, Greece 04-07 June, 2024.</b> This is the first time SDSC conference has come to Greece. </p>
        <p>This event seeks to invite cutting edge research, experience, and implementation relevant to city and infrastructure data, analytics, collaborative environments, and platforms for smarter decision making at local, national, and international levels. We encourage scholars and practitioners to share their research and experience relevant to the themes of the conference:</p></div>

			<p><strong>Workshop | Proximity Planning Modelling: Innovations, Trends, and Future Challenges in the "15-Minute City" Model</strong></p>
			<p>The 15-minute city concept has recently emerged as a fundamental design paradigm in several urban and spatial policy strategies. Unsurprisingly, the pandemic lockdowns exacerbated this situation by compelling residents to reacquaint themselves with their local surroundings. The reconfiguration of the urban system, encompassing time, space, and activities, with a focus on enhancing the quality of life, urban health, and overall well-being, shows great potential in cities where essential services and destinations such as work, housing, urban facilities, amenities, food, health services, education, culture, and leisure activities are conveniently reachable within a 15- or 30-minute walking, cycling, or public transportation commute. This strategy is essential for resolving daily intricacies, including all actions pertaining to auto-centric regulations, reducing air pollution, noise, and heat island impacts, as well as promoting green spaces and physical activity. To enhance the 15-minute city model, it is helpful to incorporate the following elements: i) Utilise diverse urban methodologies and strategies to plan for proximity. ii) Implement Smart Cities network technologies like digital twins, Internet of Things (IoT), and 6G. iii) Employ configurational analysis techniques to study cities. iv) Utilise computational analyses to model and create sustainable cities. In order to effectively implement the concept of the 15-minute city, it is essential to develop a comprehensive approach that encompasses transportation planning, urban design, and governance. This approach aims to provide well-designed public areas and streets suitable for walking, cycling, and mixeduse projects. The purpose of this session is to encourage discussions on the 15-minute city, focusing on its concept, morphological approach, structure-function models, its computational, analysis, and application in urban planning. This objective is not restricted to these topics.</p>

			<p><strong>Keynote | ICT-supported Smart City, <i>quo vadis</i>?</strong></p>
			<p>In today's landscape, the concept of Smart Cities has become mainstream, with numerous urban centers proudly adopting the label. But what exactly does it entail? In this thought-provoking keynote address, I delve into the multifaceted dimensions of Smart Cities, exploring not only various definitions but also the diverse challenges spanning housing, mobility, education, feeding, commerce, health, industry, security, and public participation. At the heart of this transformation lies the goal of enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. And how do we achieve this? through the seamless integration of information and communication technologies (ICT). From sensor-based Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to cloud management and knowledge extraction and reasoning, these technologies underpin the Smart City vision. Indeed, artificial intelligence emerges as a pivotal player in this approach. Many believe it holds the key to realizing our ultimate aspirations. During this address, I will survey AI potentialities, including knowledge management, case-based reasoning, and deep learning. However, I must also acknowledge the caveats and uncertainties that lie ahead, as the promises and pitfalls of Smart Cities are explored, envisioning a future where technology harmonizes with human well-being and sustainable urban living. The talk will be concluded by the importance of territorial intelligence, combining artificial intelligence and human collective intelligence for more sustainable cities.</p>

		<p><strong>Keynote | From Smart City to Healthy City</strong></p>
		<p>Since the first Smart City initiatives, mainly pushed by the largest information technology companies, techno-solutionist approaches have largely demonstrated their ineffectiveness in responding to the challenges faced by contemporary urban environments. One response to these limitations is the concept of a healthy city, a quite new approach promoted by the World Health Organization. A healthy city is a progressive, inclusive, connected city where people live in accessible, complete neighbourhoods, can move about freely, connect with nature and feel a sense of belonging. This conference proposes to analyze, based on some current research projects, the role that geospatial intelligence can play in the deployment of Healthy Cities.</p>

			<p><b>Description:</b></p>
			<p>Embarking on a journey to the picturesque island of Poros, nestled in the shimmering Saronic Gulf, is akin to stepping into a Greek postcard brought to life. As the ferry glides across the cerulean waters, the captivating sight of Poros emerges, with its lush greenery cascading down hillsides and quaint white-washed buildings adorning the coastline. Upon arrival, the island's charm unfolds with every step; wander through narrow cobblestone streets lined with bougainvillea-draped tavernas, where the tantalizing scent of freshly grilled seafood fills the air. Visitors can explore historical gems like the 18th-century Clock Tower, offering panoramic vistas of the azure sea, or unwind on pristine beaches such as Love Bay, where crystalline waters invite leisurely swims and moments of tranquility.</p>
			<p>Beyond its scenic allure, Poros beckons travelers to delve into its rich cultural tapestry and vibrant atmosphere. Meander through bustling markets brimming with local crafts and delicacies, or partake in traditional Greek dance performances under the starlit sky. Indulge in authentic Greek cuisine at waterfront eateries, savoring delectable dishes infused with the flavors of the Mediterranean. Whether navigating the island's idyllic coastline by kayak, immersing in its storied past at the Archaeological Museum, or simply relishing the unhurried pace of island life, Poros casts a spell that lingers long after the journey's end, a testament to the enduring allure of Greece's island treasures.</p>

        <p>The world has experienced tremendous challenges and undergone significant socio-technological transitions in recent years. This in turn has made data-driven technologies such as distributed systems, data analytics and digital platforms increasingly relevant to both the private and public sector, as well as researchers. These emerging digital paradigms - such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), Big Data and Digital Twin applications - are particularly critical to the management of Smart Cities.</p>
        <p>A Smart City is defined as a set of instruments across many scales that are connected through multiple networks and provide continuous data regarding people and environment in support of decisions about the physical and social form of the city. This process cannot be completed without technology advancements. Moreover a Smart City cannot be established without involving citizens (smart people).</p>
        <p>The 8th International Smart Data and Smart Cities (SDSC) Conference will be organised in Athens, Greece, from the 4th to the 7th June 2024. SDSC is a leading international conference focussed on the dissemination and exchange of knowledge and research results relating to urban innovation and smart technologies across the EU, North and South America and Australasia. It is initiated by the Urban Data Management Society (UDMS). With each conference, we strengthen the communication between senior researchers, students, developers, practitioners and citizens and establish collaborations on new research topics.</p>
        <p>The conference is organised under the auspices of the International Society of Photogrammetry and Remote sensing (ISPRS) and will comprise technical and scientific presentations along with a series of pre-conference workshops. We seek original contributions on all aspects of the following themes and related topics:<br></p>
